Hello, my name is Felipe Vieira de Moraes Tavares
I am 20. I lived in the two hemispheres of the world as i am brazilian resident in Galicia, Spain. I study in  ESEI http://esei.uvigo.es/ timezone: UTC+01:00


At age of 8 i decided to be a hacker. At age of 12 after learning some python my short (and harmless) hacker career stopped and i decided to be a programmer. I have been learning and programming from this age. Lots of my early works are too simple and primitive to be on github and i lose lots of them. But all that work has given me a intuitive sense of programming and a cheerful, simplistic way of solving problems.


My love of Ruby begun with my first read of “why’s poignant guide to ruby” a sublime book.
